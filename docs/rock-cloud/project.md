# Projects

Creating a project allows you to upload all of your LiDAR data and submit it for processing.

## Add New Project

Simply click 'Add New Project'

You will be presented with an easy and intuitive interface to specify your project location and upload your data.

## Project data

The ROCK Cloud supports .las, .laz., .e57, .pts, and .ply files. LAZ files are compressed and lossless LAS files. The compression of these files can be extraordinary. We recommend that all .las files be converted to .laz files prior to upload. If converted prior to upload, there will be a substantial savings in upload time and cloud storage space used.

Visit [laszip.org](https://laszip.org/) to download the command-line version 'laszip-cli.exe' or the GUI version 'laszip.exe'.

## Ground Control Points

If you have a Pro plan you will have the ability to add one or more ground control points to your project. These ground control points will be used to improve the global accuracy of your LiDAR deliverables and they will be visible in the Rock Cloud Data Visualizer.


## Save the Project

Once data is uploaded your data will be queued for processing. Processing typically takes from 1-5 minutes to complete. Once you see the LIDAR button, you know your project is ready to view.
