# Quick Flight Checklists

## Pre-flight

1. Ensure the LiDAR payload is secured to the drone, wifi antenna is attached, and GPS antenna is connected.

1. If using an external battery source for the LiDAR, ensure there is enough voltage for the mission.

1. Ensure there is enough space on the **supplied** USB stick for the flight.

1. Ensure your base station is logging RINEX data.

1. Power on the LiDAR payload and ensure no errors are being displayed on the status page.

1. Start recording data. 

1. Let UAV sit completely still for at least 15 seconds once turned on.

## Flight

1. Once landed, don't move the system for 30 seconds.

1. Log in to the LiDAR and stop collecting data.
